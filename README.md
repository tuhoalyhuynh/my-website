# My Website

This is my first website using frameworks to style.

## Installation

1. Go to [repo](https://github.com/tuhoalyhuynh/my-website) on Github
2. `fork` and `clone` repo if you would like your own repository
3. Clone to local machine
```text
git clone https://github.com/tuhoalyhuynh/my-website.git
```
4. `cd` into `my-website` directory via terminal
5. Open `index.html` in terminal to browser
```text
open index.html
```

## Usage

Website does not work. Purpose is to display a website using html, css, and frameworks. Goal is to make website look like `bungie.net` using tools listed.

### Notes

Had some trouble getting background img to work properly within grid for a bit. Used bootstrap nav bar, badge, and btn for some styling.
